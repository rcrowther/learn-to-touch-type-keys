Learn To Touch Type
===================
Python-GTK GUI for learning how to touch-type (for those who are moving along).

See also `Learn To Touch Type`_.

Requires
~~~~~~~~
Python3, GTK environment. Should work from repositories.

Install
~~~~~~~
Do not try.

The install instructions use hand-installed Ninja/Meson. Sadly, these do not work for the newish repository versions. Not only that, but this script uses built-in images. I can't be bothered to figure out ow to get a deskop install to run these. If you can, you have more money than I have.

Run it from the folder. Y'know, ::

    ./learn_to_touch_type_keys

or, ::

    python3 learn_to_touch_type_keys

    On we go. Like learning to ride a bike.

This GUI is intended for those who have never used a computer keyboard. It's scrappy and it works. It needs work itself. Not as much as GTK.

Hint: the buttons are for tutors.
Note: GTK documentation is rank. It is for the in-crowd. No, I can't contribute - I'm not in.

See also `Learn To Touch Type`_ , a sister program to this. It looks much the same but works differently. Both programs are useful (use `Learn To Touch Type`_ first, move on to this).
